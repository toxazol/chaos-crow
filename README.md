### Project description
A submission to [Untitled game jam 106](https://itch.io/jam/untitled-game-jam-106/rate/3365056).\
The game got 3rd place out of 35 entries.

I did all the programming.\
[tenori-nori](https://github.com/tenori-nori) did all the art and also music.

You can play a web version of the game [here](https://toxazol.itch.io/chaos-crow).

The game uses softbody simulation for trash bags, which allows for funny interactons with them.\
Levels are randomly generated.\
The goal of the game is to get chaos points whcih can be achieved by reaping garbage bags and scattering the garbage all around.\
Harder to reach places give more chaos points.
